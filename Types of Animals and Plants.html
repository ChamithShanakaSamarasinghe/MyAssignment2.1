The Sri Lankan leopard, also known as the "Kotiya" or "Diviy" in Sinhala, is a subspecies of leopard that is native to Sri Lanka and the country's top predator. Small indigenous cats such as the fishing cat (Prionailurus viverrinus), the Rusty spotted cat (Prionailurus rubiginosus phillipsi), and the Jungle cat (Felis chaus kelaarti) can be found throughout the country and in the zoo.</li>

                                        On September 18, 2004, Rosi the she camel arrived in the zoo. When the eight-year-old animal became ill, veterinarians assumed she was pregnant and treated her as such. However, it was later discovered that she was suffering from digestive issues. Rosi's caretaker, Dr. Samanthi Mendis, stated the animal was regularly unwell. She had previously been pregnant but had miscarried. They assumed Rosie was pregnant again because the animal displayed similar symptoms.
